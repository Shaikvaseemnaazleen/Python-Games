# Recommendation System

Online streaming platforms like Netflix have plenty of movies in their repositories and if we can build a recommendation system to recommend relevant movies to the users based on their historical interactions, this would improve customer satisfaction and hence improve revenue. The techniques that we will learn here will not only be limited to movies, it can be any item for which you want to build a recommendation system. For this project, you can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/somnambwl/bookcrossing-dataset)

## Understanding collaborative filtering and dataset

In this type of recommendation system, `we do not need any information` about the users or items. We only need user item interaction data to build a collaborative recommendation system. For example - 
<ol>
    <li><b>Ratings</b> provided by users. For example - ratings of books on goodread, movie ratings on imdb etc</li>
    <li><b>Likes</b> of users on different facebook posts, likes on youtube videos</li>
    <li><b>Use/buying</b> of a product by users. For example - buying different items on e-commerce sites</li>
    <li><b>Reading</b> of articles by readers on various blogs</li>
</ol>
